# Calculator App

Using jQuery, make a webpage that functions as a calculator. There should be buttons for each number, and a button for adding, multiplying, subtracting, dividing, and an equals sign button for computing the actual result.

Users should be able to see the number they punch in, click the operations buttons, click another number, then hit the = button to calculate the result.

They should then be able to keep going with the resulting number by hitting another operation button, another number, then = again to get a new result.

Basically, you know what a calculator is, go make one that looks and operates like a real calculator.
